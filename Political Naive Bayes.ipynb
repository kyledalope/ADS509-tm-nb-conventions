    "Based on the results, for the Republican tweets the NB classifier was able to classify 3202 as Republican and 1170 as Democractic. As for Democratic tweets, it classified 4234 as Republican and 1396 as Democractic. It seems the classification was not that accurate and heavily led towards Republican as the classifier in the results. I would further analyze the trainining data and see if further pre-processing steps are required to increase the accuracy. For example, in the pre-processing steps I could consider the use of regular expressions for text processing a bit better or to handle a class imbalance of the party column. However, the Naive Bayes classifier does tend to perform less when compared to other classifiers such as SVM, K-NN, or random forest. "
